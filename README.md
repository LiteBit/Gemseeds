# Gemseeds
Gemseeds is a fun and simple way for kids to learn all about Bitcoin seed phrases while making beautiful, personalized jewelry. Our approach takes the complexity of cryptographic security systems and turns it into an interactive experience.

Starting down the path of self-custody is often a big hurdle for Bitcoin beginners. Learning about the BIP39 wordlist, mnemonic phrases, and navigating custodial vs. non-custodial wallets is a commitment, a choice. With our children, we feel like they already have a step up on technology because this is the only world they know. What better time than now to teach them about proper sound money management?

Our kits come with 27 natural gemstones in various textures and colors. Also included are stickers, pre-measured stretchy string, dice beads, lock rings, and an instruction booklet. Our beads are durable and beautiful; however, they are not end-of-the-world proof like many metal plate backups. We don't recommend storing your family's legacy on Gemseeds jewelry. Instead, use this as a practical teaching method to encourage childrenâ€™s creativity and cultivate their interest in Bitcoin at the same time!
