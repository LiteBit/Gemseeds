# A Simple BIP-39 Wordlist
BIP-39 is a well-established standard for Bitcoin wallets that outlines a method for creating and representing seed phrases.

Seed/Recovery/Mnemonic phrases enhance the usability and security of Bitcoin wallets, making it easier for users to back up, restore, and manage their money.

## The BIP-39 Lowdown
There are 2048 words on the list, ranging from 3 to 8 characters in length.

The first four characters of each word are unique, distinguishing them from every other word on the list.

## Why make a simplified list?
Learning about seed phrase generation is a daunting first step for people wanting to self custody their Bitcoin.

Our simplified list aims to eliminate all the unnecessary characters in the BIP-39 wordlist so kids aren't bored with cryptography-speak and can focus on making beautiful, personalized jewelry.
